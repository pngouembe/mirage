# Mirage

## Use case

I want to be able to use the mirage tool for the following use cases:

- [X] Link all the files in a source folder, into a destination folder
  - [X] Create backups if the destination file already exists
- [X] Link a single file in a folder
  - [X] Create backups if the destination file already exists
- [ ] Link a single file with a new name
  - [ ] Create backups if the destination file already exists
- [ ] use a configuration file to make the installation of a folder easier
